merge-o-matic (2014.01.14.1~smcv1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Improve logging and error handling
  * Remove more unused functions
  * OBSPackage: get list of files "live" rather than relying on the cache,
    avoiding crash if it's outdated (SIN: #425)
  * model.obs: require Debian source package name = OBS package name,
    again avoiding potential crashes caused by the cache of OBS info
  * expire_pool: be a bit more object-oriented
  * momsettings: drop unused variable RSS_TIME_FORMAT
  * momlib: get globals from config, not directly from momsettings
  * merge_report: there is no MergeReport.get method, so don't crash
    trying to use it (SIN: #427)
  * update_sources: make debug messages non-misleading
  * Split Package.versions() into currentVersions() and poolVersions(),
    avoiding merge with incorrect version if one target merges from a newer
    upstream version than another (SIN: #426)
