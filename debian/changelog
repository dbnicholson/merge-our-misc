  * get_missing_bases:
    - When deciding if the base version is already present, use the same
      logic as in produce_merges (check target, then sources). Checking
      the source distros is necessary to avoid repeated downloads on
      later runs.
    - Make pool directory if it doesn't exist
   * produce_merges:
    - directly instantiate the Package object when looking for base
      versions for the merge. The previous approach of distro.package()
      won't find stuff that was downloaded by get_missing_bases since it
      is not present in the original distro from upstream.

  * Strip "ubuntu" suffix when calculating base version
  * get_missing_bases was not actually doing anything. Adjust it to use
    debsnap for significantly improved base-finding capabilities.

  * Add --force option to commit_merges.py.
  * Remove linked files after updating so that commits actually remove the
    previous source files when the local checkout is updated. (T16751)
  * Unfreeze packages before updating. When a linked package and the
    branched package both get updated, osc can freeze the link in the
    checkout. Try to fix that situation before updating so that the latest
    linked version is pulled in.

  * Strip "endless" suffix when calculating base version
  * Add support for unstable upstreams. If provided, when our version
    base is newer than the current upstream versions, we will assume
    that the package has instead come from an unstable upstream so we'll
    see if we can pull an update from unstable instead.
