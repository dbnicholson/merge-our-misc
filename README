Dependencies
------------

 * Python 2.7 or higher
 * osc
 * dpkg
 * apt-ftparchive
 * python-pychart

Deployment procedure
--------------------

Install the rpm.

Edit /etc/merge-o-matic/momsettings.py (the OBS repository URLs in DISTROS
will almost certainly need to be customized, for example).

Create an OBS account for merge-o-matic, and give it the needed privileges
for the repository project.

Switch to the mom user (e.g. "su - mom -s /bin/bash") and log in to the OBS
account using osc (e.g. "osc -A $my_obs_url") in order to generate
/srv/obs/merge-o-matic/.oscrc

To automatically run merge-o-matic, copy /usr/lib/merge-o-matic/cron.daily
to /etc/cron.daily/merge-o-matic

Output files
------------

Under /srv/obs/merge-o-matic:
merges/$NAME.html (e.g. DISTRO-standard.html) : main report
post-sync-whitelists.txt : list of packages downloaded from OBS. This is
assumed to be a subset of the upstream (Ubuntu) distribution, and packages
not in this list will not be downloaded from Ubuntu repositories.

Config files
------------

Under /srv/obs/merge-o-matic:
comments.txt : comments, will be displayed in merges/*.html
sync-blacklist.txt : packages that will be ignored by mom
