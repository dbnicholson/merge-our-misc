For detailed information on the original Ubuntu Merge-o-Matic, see:

    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MergeOMatic


Dependencies
------------

 * Python 2.7 or higher
 * osc
 * apt-utils (for apt-ftparchive)
 * deb (for dpkg-source, dpkg-genchanges)
 * python-pychart

Deployment procedure
--------------------

Install the rpm.

Edit /etc/merge-o-matic/momsettings.py (the OBS repository URLs in
DISTROS will almost certainly need to be customized, for example).

Create an OBS account for merge-o-matic, and give it the needed privileges
for the OBS repository projects.

Switch to the mom user (e.g. "su - mom -s /bin/bash") and do a small OBS checkout
using osc (e.g. "cd /tmp; osc -A https://obs:444 checkout PROJECT bash")
in order to generate /srv/obs/merge-o-matic/.oscrc and agree to permanently trust
the OBS server's SSL certificates.

merge-o-matic automatically runs a cron task under
/etc/cron.d/merge-o-matic

Output files
------------

Under /srv/obs/merge-o-matic:
merges/$NAME.html (e.g. singularity-alphacentauri-core.html) : main report
$TARGET.list.txt : list of packages in $TARGET distro that come from the
default source distro group (i.e. Ubuntu precise and precise-updates by
default); packages not in this list will not be downloaded from the default
source repositories.
$TARGET-$SRC.list.txt : list of packages in $TARGET distro that come
from the $SRC source distro group.

Config files
------------

Under /srv/obs/merge-o-matic:
comments.txt : comments, will be displayed in merges/*.html
$TARGET.ignore.txt : packages in $TARGET distro that will be ignored by MoM.
