Dependencies
------------

 * Python 2.7 or higher
 * osc
 * apt-utils (for apt-ftparchive)
 * deb (for dpkg-source, dpkg-genchanges)
 * python-pychart

Deployment procedure
--------------------

Install the rpm.

Edit /etc/merge-o-matic/momsettings.py (the OBS repository URLs in DISTROS
will almost certainly need to be customized, for example).

Create an OBS account for merge-o-matic, and give it the needed privileges
for the repository project.

Switch to the mom user (e.g. "su - mom -s /bin/bash") and do a small OBS checkout
using osc (e.g. "cd /tmp; osc -A https://SERVER:444 checkout DISTRO bash") in
order to generate /srv/obs/merge-o-matic/.oscrc and agree to permanently trust
the OBS server's SSL certificates.

To automatically run merge-o-matic, comment out the "exit" line at the top of
/etc/cron.daily/merge-o-matic-local

Output files
------------

Under /srv/obs/merge-o-matic:
merges/$NAME.html (e.g. DISTRO-standard.html) : main report
post-sync-whitelists.txt : list of packages downloaded from OBS. This is
assumed to be a subset of the upstream (Ubuntu) distribution, and packages
not in this list will not be downloaded from Ubuntu repositories.

Config files
------------

Under /srv/obs/merge-o-matic:
comments.txt : comments, will be displayed in merges/*.html
sync-blacklist.txt : packages that will be ignored by mom
